Objectives for today:

DONE Edit current PSSM code to take PSSM input files from the PSI-BLAST we ran

DONE Add loop code to open each PSSM file and append it to the list of PSSMs for each residue

DONE How to match amino acid positions with features since they are no longer in order?

Figure out how best to run the cross validation and visualize performance of the SVM

New problem found: Duplicate protein names in dataset file, but to run PSI-BLAST we modified the names of the files when there was a duplicate to contain _2 etc at the end. Therefore when pulling PSI-BLAST data I'm always pulling from the original ID file because I'm pulling according to protID from the dataset file.
